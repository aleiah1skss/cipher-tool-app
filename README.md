# cipher-tool-app
Advanced Cipher Tool with Caesar and Vigen√®re Ciphers


Advanced Cipher Tool üîê
This is a modern, user-friendly web application built with Streamlit to demonstrate foundational and intermediate cryptographic algorithms. This project was completed as part of the SkillCraft Technology Internship to showcase skills in Python programming, algorithmic implementation, and web application deployment.

Key Features
Dual Cipher Modes: Implements both a simple and a complex substitution cipher.

Caesar Cipher: Encrypts/decrypts using a single numerical shift.

Vigen√®re Cipher: Encrypts/decrypts using a repeating keyword, making it significantly more secure.

User-Friendly Interface (Streamlit): Deployed as a web application for easy access and professional presentation.

Input Validation: Ensures the Vigen√®re key is alphabetic and provides clear feedback.

How to Access the App
The application is deployed live on the Streamlit Community Cloud.

That's a fantastic idea! A README.md file is crucial for any professional project, as it's the first thing users and potential employers (like your mentor) will see.

Here is the structure and content you should use for your README.md file. Create a new file named exactly README.md in your GitHub repository and paste this content into it.
