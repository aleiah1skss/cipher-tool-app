Advanced Cipher Tool with Caesar and Vigenère Ciphers


Advanced Cipher Tool 🔐
This is a modern, user-friendly web application built with Streamlit to demonstrate foundational and intermediate cryptographic algorithms. This project was completed as part of the SkillCraft Technology Internship to showcase skills in Python programming, algorithmic implementation, and web application deployment.

Key Features
Dual Cipher Modes: Implements both a simple and a complex substitution cipher.

Caesar Cipher: Encrypts/decrypts using a single numerical shift.

Vigenère Cipher: Encrypts/decrypts using a repeating keyword, making it significantly more secure.

User-Friendly Interface (Streamlit): Deployed as a web application for easy access and professional presentation.

Input Validation: Ensures the Vigenère key is alphabetic and provides clear feedback.

How to Access the App
The application is deployed live on the Streamlit Community Cloud.
